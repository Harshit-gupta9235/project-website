            <h3>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </h3>

            <h3>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</h3>

        <div class="intro" id="Javascript and java">
            <h1>Javascript and java</h1>
            <h3>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.
    
                Features of Javascript are as follows: 
                
                JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.
                Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.
                Can handle date and time.
                Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.
                No compiler is needed.</h3>
    
        </div>
        <div class="intro" id="Hello world">
            <h1>Hello world</h1>
            <h3>
                A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, this program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.
            </h3>
    
               <pre> We will use these three ways to print 'Hello, World!'.
                
                console.log()
                alert()
                document.write()
                1. Using console.log()
                console.log() is used in debugging the code.
                
                Source Code
                
                // the hello world program
                console.log('Hello World');
                Run Code
                Output
                
                Hello, World!
                
                Here, the first line is a comment.
                
                // the hello world program
                The second line
                
                console.log('Hello, World!');
                prints the 'Hello, World!' string to the console.
                
               
                2. Using alert()
                <h3>The alert() method displays an alert box over the current window with the specified message.
                </h3>
                Source Code
                
                // the hello world program
                alert("Hello, World!");
                Run Code
                3. Using document.write()
                <h3> document.write() is used when you want to print the content to the HTML document.
                </h3>
                Source Code
                
                // the hello world program
                document.write('Hello, World!');
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="intro" id="Variables">
            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <h3>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
                There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
               <ol>
                <li> Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign</li>
                <li> After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.</li>
                <li> JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.</li>
               </ol>
